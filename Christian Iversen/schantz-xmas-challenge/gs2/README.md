# GS2 documentation

## What is GS2?

GS2 is a stack-based, concatenative programming language with functional influences, inspired by [GolfScript](http://www.golfscript.com/) and [J](http://jsoftware.com/). Its primary purpose is doing well at [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) contests; it achieves this by supplying many built-in commands and syntactical shortcuts that are each only one byte long.

Programming in GS2 is conceptually similar to programming in GolfScript or similar languages: the stack initially contains a string representing standard input, and its contents are printed to standard output when the program is finished.

## Values

GS2 values are integers, blocks, or lists. Blocks contain unevaluated code, representing "functions", like in GolfScript. There is no dedicated string type: strings are just lists of integers.

## Tokens

Throughout this document mnemonics are listed next to some token names; these
are compatible with the included gs2c utility.

Special tokens are:

Token | Meaning
----- | -------
`$01 $xx` | Push unsigned byte `$xx` to stack.
`$02 $yy $xx` | Push signed short `$xxyy` to stack.
`$03 $zz $yy $xx $ww` | Push signed short `$wwxxyyzz` to stack.
`$04 ss* $zz` | Push string(s) to stack. _ss_ is separated by `$07`; the action performed is decided by the string end byte `$zz`, see below.
`$07 $cc` | Push single-character string `"\xcc"` to stack.
`$08` | Opens a block.
`$09` | Closes a block.
`%111xxyyy` (hex values `$e0` through `$fb`) | Wraps last _y_ + 1 values into a block. _x_ is the final token (what do we do with this block?): 0=nop, 1=map (`$34`), 2=filter (`$35`), 3=apply on both of top 2 elements (`$38`)
`$xx $fc` (`dm1`, `dump-map1`) | Map single token inside lists. Short for `$08 $90 $xx $09 $34`.
`$xx $fd` (`df1`, `dump-filter1`) | Filter single token inside lists. Short for `$08 $90 $xx $09 $35`.
`$fe` (`m:`) | Open rest-of-program map block.
`$ff` (`f:`) | Open rest-of-program filter block.

The end bytes for `$04` mean the following:

End byte | Meaning
-------- | -------
`$05` | push strings to stack, sequentially
`$06` | push strings to stack in array
`$9b` | `sprintf` (pops format from _ss_, pops fitting number of items from stack, pushes formatted string)
`$9c` | regex match (pops regex from _ss_, pops string from stack, pushes `1` on match, else `0`)
`$9d` | regex replace (pops replacement string from _ss_, pops regex from _ss_, pops string from stack and pushes `re.sub` result)
`$9e` | regex find (like `$9c`, but calls `re.findall`)
`$9f` | regex split (like `$9c`, but calls `re.split`)

The regexes used by these operations may be prefixed by special characters to set a special variable _c_: by default it is `0`, prefixing the regex by `$5D` sets it to 1, prefixing it by `$7D $xx` sets it to `$xx`. _c_ affects the operations as follows:

*   `$9c`: match whole string if _c_ > 0
*   `$9d`: perform at most _c_ substitutions (unlimited if _c_ = 0)
*   `$9e`: find first matching substring only if _c_ > 0 (else array of matching substrings)
*   `$9f`: perform at most _c_ splits (unlimited if _c_ = 0)
Furthermore, if the first character of a program is `$04`, it may be omitted; an unmatched string closing token will automatically be paired up. (`gs2c` will automatically perform this optimization.)

The following single-byte tokens have special meaning at the start of a program:

Mode | Meaning
---- | -------
`$30` (`line-mode`) | Line mode: `[program] -> [lines, map program, unlines]`
`$31` (`word-mode`) | Word mode: `[program] -> [words, map program, unwords]`
`$32` (`line-mode-skip-first`) | Like `$30`, but ignore first line.

All other tokens are simple operations that pop values from the stack and push results back.

## Constants

The following single-byte tokens push constants to the stack:

Byte | Constant
---- | --------
`$0a` (`new-line`) | `[$0a]`
`$0b` (`empty-list`) | `[]`
`$0c` (`empty-block`) | `{}`
`$0d` (`space`) | `[$20]`
`$10` - `$1a` | `0` - `10`
`$1b` | `100`
`$1c` | `1000`
`$1d` | `16`
`$1e` | `64`
`$1f` | `256`

## Functions

Opcode | Meaning
------ | -------
`$0e` (`make-array, extract-array`) | Pop number _n_, then pop _n_ elements and push them back into an array; pop array and push each element.
`$20` (`negate, reverse, eval`) | Negate numbers; reverse lists; evaluate blocks.
`$21` (`bnot, head`) | Bitwise-negates numbers; extract first element from lists.
`$22` (`not, tail`) | Boolean negation for numbers; drop first element from lists.
`$23` (`abs, init`) | Absolute value for numbers; drop last element from lists.
`$24` (`digits, last`) | Push array of base 10 digits for numbers; extract last element from lists.
`$25` (`random`) | Push `random.randint(0, x-1)` for numbers _x_; choose random element for lists.
`$26` (`dec, left-uncons`) | Subtract 1 from numbers; pushes tail and then head for lists.
`$27` (`inc, right-uncons`) | Add 1 to numbers; pushes init and then last for lists.

`$2b` (`half, unlines`) | Divide numbers by 2; join with newlines for lists.
`$2c` (`square, words`) | Square numbers; split list into words.
`$2d` (`sqrt, unwords`) | Integer square root for numbers, join with space for lists.
`$2e` (`range, length`) | Push `[0..n-1]` for numbers _n_, `length` for lists.
`$2f` (`range1, sort`) | Push `[1..n]` for numbers _n_; sorts lists; `sortBy` for blocks.
`$30` (`add, cat, +`) | Add numbers, catenate lists/blocks.
`$31` (`sub, diff, -`) | Subtract numbers, set difference for lists.
`$32` (`mul, join, times, fold, \*`) | Multiply numbers; repeats a list _n_ times; join list of lists with another; fold block over list.
`$33` (`div, chunks, split, each, /`) | Divide numbers; splits a list in chunks of size _n_; split two lists; call block with each element of list.
`$34` (`mod, step, clean-split, map, %`) | Modulo numbers; each nth element for list+number; split two lists removing empty lists; maps block over list.
`$35` (`and, get, when, filter, &`) | Bitwise and numbers; index list; eval block only when number on top of stack is non-zero, filter list by block.
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. You know what, just read the mnemonics in gs2.py and mess around with them. If you need to know anything ask me via [mail](mailto:0nooodl@gmail.com) or IRC (I'm mauris in #anagol on freenode.)

## Example usage and gs2c

The included gs2c.py script is an "assembler" that compiles a more readable representation of gs2 opcodes and constants. It reads mnemonics for gs2 functions from the source code of gs2.py itself! Let's write a simple program, compile it using gs2c.py, and run it.

A very simple golf challenge is the following: given a positive integer _n_ on standard input, print a triangle of asterisks of size _n_:

    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****

We read the number, then map a block over `[1..n]`, turning each number into asterisks followed by a newline:

    read-num range1 m: "*" times new-line

Then gs2c can compile this, and gs2 can run the resulting file:

    $ python gs2c.py < stars > compiled && echo 7 | python gs2.py compiled
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ******
    *******

Our solution is 7 bytes long: `56 2f fe 07 2a 32 0a`. This is pretty good compared to GolfScript's 11.
